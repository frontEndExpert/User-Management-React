Description

This is web application used to store contacts online. It is very minimal and small and can grow to a more complex application. You can add, view, edit or delete contacts. This is a very simple app which is developed in ReactJS. There are options to input information such as name, contact age and contact nickname. The data is stored in LOCALSTORAGE.

Functionality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a ReactJS web application which I developed and styled using the Bootstrap CSS Framework The application reads the input from html form elements and stores it on LOCALSTORAGE with unique id. Unique id is used when you want to delete or update a contact.

I designed the application using the Bootstrap framework which lets us build mobile friendly web application with its built in libraries.
